  ## Desciption
  The README generator is an app that runs in the command line via the Node JS runtime. The app asks the user to submit the content of the README section by section, and compiles the respones into a formatted markdown document that the user can then copy into their project.

  ## Installation
  If you already have Node JS installed, clone the [read-me-generator](https://github.com/djbartolini/read-me-generator) repository, open it in your command line, run `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`, and you're good to go!

  If you don't already have Node JS, then it must be installed first. You can do this by visiting nodejs.org and following their instructions for downloading the right version for your OS. Once you have installed their package from the website, you can run `node -v` in the command line to verify that node was installed properly. Next, you must also clone the respository for the README generator from GitHub. This can be accessed at the [read-me-generator](https://github.com/djbartolini/read-me-generator) repository. On this page, you will see a green button that says "<> Code" near the middle. Clicking this will then display a drop-down where you can get a link to clone this repo onto your local machine. This app runs using the inquirer NPM package. This is easily installed by running `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in the command line. Then, to run the README Generator, access the read-me-generator directory in the command line, and run `node index.js` to get started.

  ## Usage
  Follow the instructions above for installation. Once Node JS and inquirer are installed, access the read-me-generator directory in the command line, and run the command `node index.js`. The app will then run right from the command line! Once complete, a README will be generated as a markdown file at the root level of the README-generator directory. The README is now ready to go! Also, if desired, the markdown file can be edited to make any further changes or add images.
